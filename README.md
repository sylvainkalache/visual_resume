Story
-----

[Simla Ceyhan](www.linkedin.com/in/simla), [Yifu Diao](http://www.linkedin.com/in/yifudiao) and [I](http://www.linkedin.com/in/sylvainkalache) created this project for the [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/) hackathon October 2013. This project gave us the second place at the hackathon.

We thought that LinkedIn give us the possibility to give very interesting insights about profesionnal that we could not get before it. Indeed, we know have a lot of metadata that allow us to figure out the profile of a person pretty quickly.

Companies are often asking for a pdf version of your resume, the candidate can come up with an original, easy to read version of his profile.
